"""Count employees in an org chart.

Our organization has the following org chart::

                    Jane
          Jessica          Janet
       Al  Bob  Jen     Nick  Nora
                                Henri

Let's make this chart::

    >>> henri = Node("Henri")
    >>> nora = Node("Nora", [henri])
    >>> nick = Node("Nick")
    >>> janet = Node("Janet", [nick, nora])
    >>> al = Node("Al")
    >>> bob = Node("Bob")
    >>> jen = Node("Jen")
    >>> jessica = Node("Jessica", [al, bob, jen])
    >>> jane = Node("Jane", [jessica, janet])

And test our counting function::

    >>> henri.count_employees()
    0

    >>> nora.count_employees()
    1

    >>> jane.count_employees()
    8

We provide a non-recursive version, let's make sure that gives the same
answer::

    >>> jane.count_employees_nonrecursive()
    8

# brainstorm:
    # want to traverse tree (either depth/breadth method), keeping
    # a counter in the process. traverse until children is None (meaning leaf)
    # at the end, have a lst of all nodes. count how many items in final lst.
    # recursive method -- progress until base case where children is None
        # children = kept in list? pop off w/ each traversal until empty lst?
        # popping from to_visit lst could be where counter is
